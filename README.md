<h3>Version: 1.0.0</h3>

<h3> The password checker project allows the user to securely check if his/ her password has been hacked. This is a very secure was of checking becasue it leverages an API from https://haveibeenpwned.com/ without actually sending your password to an external system (K-anonymity).</h3>

<h4> To run this project:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Run from your Terminal (Mac) / or similar in windows</li>
  <li>python3 </li>
  <li>python3 checkmypass.py password123</li>

</ul>
